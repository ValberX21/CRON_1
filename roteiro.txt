Welcome

Let's do a CRON
CRON is a automation in javascript, where you make a code to be execute every ten seconds or one hour

so let's go:

1Ëš you will need install:
 npm init -y
 node-cron
 dotenv
 winsdson

CODING...

in first file we just call script to be executed:
(index)


Here is CRON, here we set how much time code will be
execute, to this example I will set 10s

I will let in description a table to you understand
already let your like

Interval	CRON expression
Every 30 seconds	*/30 * * * * *
Every 30 minutes	*/30 * * * *
Every 1 hour	    0 * * * *
Every 24 hours	    0 0 * * *
Every 48 hours	    0 0 */2 * *

Now I will call an api that I did some day ago to practice DDD

Here is a basic api call in JS, I missing something in api SSL so I using
this code just to work 

NEVER, NEVER DO THIS IN PRODUCTION !!!!!

corte

So, Always remember parameter your enviroment variable, like 
security key or api url, because if you fix in the code 
in many different files trust in me,
just wait my friend
you will have a BIG PROBLEM LATER

this logger is very good to we check what happen. we have step by step
here is the classs:



So let's see working:

WONDERFUL, sucess !
